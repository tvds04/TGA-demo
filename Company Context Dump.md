Who Is The Good Acre (TGA)?
The Good Acre is a Minnesota-based nonprofit food hub headquartered in Falcon Heights, MN, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025. It is the largest food hub of its kind in Minnesota. TGA's mission is to unlock economic opportunity for local farmers — particularly small-scale, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), immigrant, and emerging farmers — by connecting them to wholesale markets they could not access on their own.
TGA operates by purchasing produce from a network of 130+ local farm partners, aggregating it at their Falcon Heights facility, and redistributing it to a network of institutional buyers including schools, hospitals, college campuses, hunger-relief organizations, grocery chains (including Lunds & Byerlys), and corporate cafeterias. In 2024, TGA moved over $2.6 million in purchasing, with 73% of that going directly to BIPOC growers.
What Problem Does TGA Solve?
Small and emerging farmers face a fundamental market access problem: selling at farmers' markets is time-intensive and volume-limited, while selling wholesale directly to large institutions requires relationships, logistics, and consistent supply volumes that small farms can't meet alone. TGA sits in the middle — aggregating supply from many small farms and delivering it as a reliable, unified source to large buyers. Farmers get access to markets they couldn't reach alone. Buyers get fresh, local produce without managing dozens of farm relationships.
Beyond market access, TGA provides grower support services led by a small team of advisors. These services include one-on-one farm consulting, crop planning, business planning education, food safety guidance, wholesale readiness training, and supply materials (fertilizer, packaging). The core insight is that market access alone isn't enough — farmers also need support learning how to operate within wholesale dynamics, which are fundamentally different from selling at a farmers' market.
Who Does TGA Serve?
TGA serves two primary groups:

Farmers: Primarily small-scale (1–10 acre) specialty vegetable growers in Minnesota, with a strong focus on BIPOC and immigrant farming communities including Hmong, Latinx, East African, and other New American farmers. Many of these growers have varying levels of English proficiency and technology comfort.
Buyers: Institutional purchasers including K-12 schools, college campuses, hospitals, hunger-relief food shelves, grocery retailers, and corporate dining programs across Minnesota.

TGA also runs a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program serving 700+ households, and a LEAFF program (farm-to-food shelf) that channels locally grown produce to hunger-relief organizations. In 2024, TGA donated 270,000+ lbs of produce through hunger-relief channels.
The App: GrowTogether
GrowTogether is a mobile-first platform designed to centralize TGA's existing services — communication, business intelligence tools, and farmer education — into one accessible hub. The app is not about adding new services; it's about making TGA's existing support easier to access and scale. It is designed for farmers with varying levels of technology comfort and should feel approachable, warm, and immediately useful.

Never use harsh or bright colors — the palette should feel earthy, warm, and trustworthy
