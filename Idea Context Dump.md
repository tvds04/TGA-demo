The following is context about the full idea for the app that is being built. it is being built for a nonprofit that helps small minnesota farmers. Make the app UI clean and modern, and simple, as a demonstration for a case competition:Core Concept
App platform centralizing TGA's existing services into one accessible hub for small Minnesota farmers
Goal: improve and scale what TGA already does — not expand scope
No new workflows — replaces existing friction rather than adding steps, and integrates into existing TGA offering and workflows
Personalization: adapt feeds and tool/lesson recommendations to the farmer’s profile, crops, tech comfort, location, preferences etc.
Intro survey to gather this info
as well as ongoing algorithm engagement tracking?

Three Pillars
1. Communication and community
Purpose: Replace scattered touchpoints (phone calls, emails, ad hoc in-person) with a centralized and personalized, low-friction channel
Personalized Feed
Content filtered by: crop type, farm proximity, self-reported tech comfort level
Farmers who opt out of (e.g.) IoT suggestions won't see them
Onboarding quiz sets initial preferences; algorithm adjusts over time
Social Spaces
Farmer-to-farmer messaging
Crop-specific groups (e.g., Hmong vegetable growers, organic producers)
Regional clusters based on proximity
Multilingual: Hmong, Spanish, Somali, English — day one, not an afterthought
TGA Broadcast Channel
Program updates, new services, policy changes, best practices, research, etc.
Market insights and seasonal alerts
Event calendar + RSVP
Quarterly Retreats (in-person)
4 per year, one per season, aligned to farming calendar
Hosted and funded by TGA; open to farmers and community members
Sponsor model pursued to offset costs (businesses, wholesalers, buyers); TGA covers remainder
Agenda structure:
TGA shares upcoming programs, insights, and platform updates
Structured farmer-to-farmer networking
Institutional buyers (schools, hospitals, Lunds & Byerlys) invited to meet growers directly → humanizes supply chain, strengthens Richardson's buyer relationships
Community building and general growth programming

2. Insights & Business Intelligence
Purpose: Turn TGA's unique on-farm data advantage into decision-making tools farmers can actually use
Cost of Production Calculator
Farmers input their costs → see profitability by crop before committing
Built with Minnesota-specific specialty crop data collected by TGA advisors during farm visits
Key differentiator: UW/Oregon tools lack real collected data; TGA has it (Bryceson quote from case)
Pricing Tools
Live pricing benchmarks for key crops
Packaging cost guidance
Seasonal pricing strategy recommendations
Fulfillment Dashboard
Farmers see own fulfillment rate vs. TGA network average (Richardson's explicit want)
Order history and delivery performance tracking
Order Management
View active purchase orders from TGA
Confirm or flag shortages directly in-app
Replaces current phone/email confirmation loop entirely
TGA Initiative Integrations (centralizing existing programs)
LEAFF: track farm-to-food shelf orders; farmers see lbs donated and dollars earned
CSA: growers supplying CSA boxes see volume, member feedback
Spoke site partners (Big River Farms, HAFA, Sharing Our Roots, etc.): same platform access as direct TGA partners
Lunds & Byerlys retail channel: order history and buyer feedback tracker
Data Cohesion (Internal)
App sits on top of NetSuite (orders) and Airtable (farm profiles) — does not replace either
Bridges the two systems: Bryceson no longer manually cross-references
All grower activity (orders, tool usage, module completions) flows into unified grower profile visible to TGA team
Clean API architecture — no new data silos created; designed for future integrations

“Bryceson believes the organization could be a clearinghouse that gathers, synthesizes, and curates information for the type of farmers the organization works with.”

3. Education
Purpose: Scale Bryceson's 2–3 person team to effectively serve 130+ growers (and eventually more) without proportional hiring
Tiered Learning Module Structure
Level 1 — Wholesale Readiness Basics (Free)
Pack standards, visual standards, sizing requirements
Gross vs. net, cost of production fundamentals
Format: short videos + quizzes
Level 2 — Advanced Business Planning (Premium)
Crop planning for profitability, scaling operations
Securing loans, reading financials, grant writing basics
Format: longer modules, worksheets, advisor Q&A access
Level 3 — Certifications (Premium)
Formal credential farmers can use with lenders and buyers
Co-developed and issued through university partner (see below)
University Partnership — Primary: University of Minnesota (CFANS)
Co-develop curriculum with UMN College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences faculty
UMN certification adds academic credibility and concrete premium value prop
Internship pipeline: UMN ag/MIS students assist with TGA operations and platform development
Capstone/case competition model: student teams solve real problems for TGA farm partners
University Partnership — Fallback Cascade (if UMN declines)
Other Minnesota universities (Minnesota State system, St. Thomas, Carleton, etc.)
Individual faculty or subject matter experts from any university
Minnesota-based companies and business partners
TGA's institutional buyers and wholesaler purchasers as guest content contributors
Minnesota government departments (MDA, MN Extension)
Self-developed content — TGA produces independently, pursues university partnership in Phase 2
Engagement Tracking (Bryceson's admin view)
Which growers completed which modules and quiz scores
Last login and overall engagement level
Automated nudges (push notification or SMS) if grower hasn't completed pre-season training before key deadline
All data surfaces in unified grower profile alongside order and fulfillment data

Business Model: Freemium
Philosophy: Revenue enables sustainability — funds platform development, additional grower support hires, and mission delivery. Not profit maximization.
Free Tier
Retreats
All community and social features
TGA insights feed
Level 1 introductory lessons
Tool previews (e.g., cost calculator limited version)
Order confirmations
Premium Tier (price TBD)
Full lesson library (Level 2 + Level 3)

Conversion Logic
Farmers get tangible value immediately (community, market insights, free tools) → trust is built → premium is a natural next step when ready to scale
No pressure model: free tier is genuinely useful, not crippled
